simpledb
========

This is a custom version of Sciore's simpledb code by Chengyu Sun for CSULA-CS422. I have repackaged it to be built with Apache Ant (instead of Eclipse) for my course work.

A clean package can be built using the ant command in the package's root directory.

    ant

The simpledb server can be started using the following command:

    java -jar ./build/jar/simpledb.jar [DATABASE NAME]
